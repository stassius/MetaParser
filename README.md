# MetaParser
LightWeight windows application that shows Stable Diffusion metadata in images.
You can drag and drop an image to the MetaParser or start it with the name of the image file as a command line option.
Click on a row -> copy to clipboard.
Escape -> Close the application.

That way you can configure your favourite image viewer to run the MetaParser.
